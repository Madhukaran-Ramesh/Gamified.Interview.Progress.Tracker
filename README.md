# Gamified.Interview.Progress.Tracker
This is a Python Flask web app that helps users track their progress as they prepare for technical interviews. The app features a gamified interface: a digital garden that visually grows as users complete more progress.

## Features
- User login/registration (username only)
- Progress tracking (increments by 10% per task for demo)
- Visual digital garden that grows as progress increases
- Simple, clean UI
